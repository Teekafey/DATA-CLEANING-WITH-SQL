# DATA-CLEANING-WITH-SQL

Data is an essential component of any organization, and its accuracy and completeness are critical to making informed decisions. However, data is rarely perfect, and it is common to find errors, inconsistencies, or missing values. These data quality issues can have a significant impact on the results of data analysis, and it is essential to address them through a data cleaning process.

In this project, we will focus on data cleaning using SQL.
